# DamageSourceForEnemies
In vanilla there isn't a single enemy attack that has a DamageSource set, which means that items that rely on specific skill hits and mods that look for a skill's DamageSource will never work with enemies. This mod fixes that by giving *every* enemy attack a proper DamageSource based on the skill slot an attack is in.

## Possible bugs
I've tested this in multiplayer before releasing this and it seems fine, but I have not tested this with any mod that rebalances enemies or changes their AI. If this does end up causing any issues with those types of mods, make a github issue here or ping me in the RoR2 modding disord.
