## 1.1.0

Fixed for SOTS phase 2

Gave the flamethrower drone the correct DamageSource
- It was basing itself off of Artificer's, so it had the "Special" DamageSource before this. Now it has the "Primary" DamageSource as it should.

Added a few config options for some enemies' ground damage zones getting a DamageSource
- Mini Mushrum's spore attack (on by default)
- Beetle Queen's spit attack (off by default)
- Voidling's one attack that leaves a big damage zone (off by default)

## 1.0.0

- First release
