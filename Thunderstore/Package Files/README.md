# DamageSourceForEnemies
In vanilla there isn't a single enemy or drone attack that has a DamageSource set, which means that items that rely on specific skill hits and mods that look for a skill's DamageSource will never work with enemies or drones. This mod fixes that by giving *every* enemy and drone attack a proper DamageSource based on the skill slot an attack is in.
